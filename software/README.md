This directory contains files associated with the ODIn project and not necessarily active development.

The _server-side_ code (based on contents of "David Beck's C interception..." folder) currently lives at [https://github.com/BeckResearchLab/ODIn_dataServer](https://github.com/BeckResearchLab/ODIn_dataServer) and is actively maintained there. In December 2019 the code was updated to run on a new raspberry pi server.
