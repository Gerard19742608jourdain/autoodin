Use the arduino-1.0.6-windows.exe Arduino IDE.
Anything else will give errors.

There are some libraries which are used with System 2, namely to work the ADC, DAC, WIFI, and LCD
Many of these programs in this Software folder WILL NOT COMPILE with the stock Arduino sketch
environment, because the libraries haven't been loaded.
In order to get the programs to compile, and load on the arduino, do the following:
Locate where Arduino installed on the computer you are using.
On my 64-bit Windows 8.1 machine, it installed here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino
However on a 32-bit machine, it might have installed to the regular Program Files folder.
Then, in that "Arduino" folder where the Arduino software installed, re-name the "libraries" folder
to something like "stock_libraries"
Then, inside the Software folder for the System 2 project, go inside the "NECESSARY LIBRARIES"
folder and copy the "libraries" folder found there to the "Arduino" folder where the Arduino
software was installed.
Note: I also had to do this in a second location, "\Documents\Arduino\libraries".
Now restart the Arduino sketch program and the software should compile.

I have provided links to where the various new libraries were found online, in the "Web Links"
folder of the System 2 Project Files folder.
There shouldn't be any problems with the libraries, with the exception of the WIFI library
The CC3000 wireless chip, by Adafruit, was pretty new when we started using it, and thus there
are still some minor issues, and the library is still under development. It would be wise to
check up on their progress from time to time to see if their developments could help our project.
